# Mapping Transgender Rights in R Studio

This workshop, developed for Transgender Awareness Week 2024 at the University of Colorado Boulder Libraries, provides participants with an introduction to creating maps that display information about transgender rights-protections across the world. It draws on data published by Myles Williamson as part of the Trans Rights Indicator Project (TRIP).
